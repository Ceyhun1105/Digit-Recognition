# Digit-recognizer

Hello,
This code recognizes digits. 
I uploaded a file and folder with zip extension. 
Unzip the folder and you will see the folder named mnist. 
There are numbers 0-9 and the model inside.
Transfer that folder to your Drive. 
I added the ready model so that you can use it alone if you do not want to train. 
It can take up to 20 minutes to train. 
You may need to download the libraries.
Thanks.
